# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly looking to expand my programming skills and enhance my knowledge of C#. This project was developed to practice working with the DateTime class and to understand how to retrieve and manipulate date and time data in C#.

This software outputs a simple greeting and displays the current time. Additionally, it calculates the number of days remaining until Christmas of the current year, providing a countdown. The goal was to familiarize myself with basic input/output operations, date manipulation, and formatted strings in C#.
